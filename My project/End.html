            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>Do you know what's literally crazy?</p>
            <p>When you messaged me, I was drivin'</p>
            <p>And in my head, I was just like, "I need to listen to Trippie right now"</P>
            <p>And I just was playin' your whole, like two of your albums</P>
            <p>Like for twenty-five minutes, literally</P>           
            <p>And then I went on my phone when I just got out of my car</P>
            <p>And I see your message, it's meant to be</P><br>
            <b><em><p>I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you</p>
            <p>I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you</p>
            <p>I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you</p></b></em></br>
            <p>'Til the end, the ends of time</p>      
            <p>Try to get in, let me inside</p>
            <p>Baby, give in, let me inside</p>
            <p>Baby, your whole life depends on this</p>
            <p>Put your pride to the side (yeah, yeah, uh)</p><br>
            <p> No way I'm lost with you, 'cause I can find</p>
            <p>Anything I want to, with you by my side</p>
            <p>This love ain't all brand new, 'til the end of time</p>
            <p>I wanna be with you, bae, until I die, yeah</p>
            <p>Don't you go givin' up on me, love me forever (givin' up on me)</p>
            <p>Love me forever, oh</p>
            <p>I want your love for eternity (I want your love, I want your love), eternity</p>
            <p>Yeah, give me a soul, soul</p>
            <p>I wanna love you from the flesh to the bones, yeah, yeah, oh (givin' up on me)</p>
            <p>We standin' under the blood moon, I know that I love you, oh</p><br>
            <p>'Til the end, the ends of time</p>
            <p>Try to get in, let me inside</p>
            <p>Baby, give in, let me inside</p>
            <p>Baby, your whole life depends on this</p>
            <p>Put your pride to the side (uh)</p><br>
            <p>No way I'm lost with you, 'cause I can find</p>
            <p>Anything I want to, with you by my side</p>
            <p>This love ain't all brand new, 'til the end of time</p>
